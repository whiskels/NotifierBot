#### PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT WON'T COMPILE (as I am too lazy to create a self-sufficient working demo profile)
Due to security restrictions this repository doesn't contain tokens.

If you would like to run this code:
 - 'dev' profile by default does not include any Slack reporters - they can be enabled by adding 'slack-dev' profile to active profiles
 - Telegram bot can be enabled by adding telegram.bot.token property value in telegram-dev config
 - Bot admin token 'telegram.bot.admin' is required to send start-up report and unauthorized request messages

Feature toggles can be discovered by looking out for @ConditionalOnProperty annotation

___
### Technologies used: 
Java 14, Spring (Boot, Data JPA), Hibernate, Postgres, H2, Flyway and a bunch of APIs (Slack, Telegram, Google Sheets).

___
#### Features:
- Separate profiles (dev, prod)
- CI/CD in Travis with automatic deployment of the latest version of master branch to Heroku
